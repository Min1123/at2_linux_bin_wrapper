This is a wrapper script that builds (via buildroot) a small set of i386 linux libraries, and allows for qemu-i386 to run AdTrack2 (an OPL3 tracker program that includes an OPL3 emulator) on any modern Linux system.

Run bootstrap.sh to execute a buildroot build.  Use ./at2.sh to start the program.
